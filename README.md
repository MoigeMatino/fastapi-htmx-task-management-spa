## Unique Approach

This project demonstrates a unique approach to building web applications by combining FastAPI with HTMX. By leveraging HTMX, the app provides a highly dynamic user experience with real-time updates directly in the browser without requiring full page reloads. Additionally, JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is integrated to manage user sessions securely. This approach showcases how modern libraries can be integrated to create responsive, efficient, and secure web applications, even for seemingly simple tasks like managing a Todo list.

## Features

- Create new todo items.
- Update the title of existing todo items.
- Toggle the completion status of todo items.
- Delete todo items.
- Real-time updates with HTMX.
- JWT authentication for secure access.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **HTMX**: A library that allows you to access modern browser features directly from HTML.
- **Jinja2**: A templating engine for Python.
- **Simple.css**: A classless CSS framework.
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
